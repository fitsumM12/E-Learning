# E Learning Platform

"Welcome to our e-learning platform! Our platform is the result of a collaborative effort from a team of Ethiopian computer science students at KIIT University who graduated in 2021. Chala Getachew led the development of the home section, Abreham Wondimu worked on the admin section, Temam Hashim designed the student section, and Fitsum Mesfin developed faculty section. Our platform is designed to provide an interactive and accessible learning experience for students and faculty. With features such as course management, student tracking, and online assessments, our platform is tailored to meet the needs of modern-day education. We hope you find our platform user-friendly and valuable in your academic pursuits."
